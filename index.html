                <div class="container"><p>The U.S. Healthcare system is something that is brought up a lot. Whether on discussions on the reasons behind many debts for Americans, the untimely deaths for minority groups, or the barrier of access that prevent some from even receiving this care. Many people get hurt, sick, or injured on the daily. Then why does the system in the U.S. seem to work against those who are already suffering?Throughout this website we will examine the ways the U.S. Healthcare system often fails for minority groups, racial, sexual, gender, and those who are suffering economically. Like a small umbrella, the healthcare system seems to be designed for a specific group of people and all those who don’t fit within that small archetype are left to deal with the consequences. Because of this, the U.S. Healthcare system very well goes against the definition of social justice- by enforcing a system that often excludes many people economically, socially, and unfairly.Hopefully, by advocating for these groups who suffer under this unjust system, we can bring awareness and change. Through advocacy or protest we can find lawmakers who can try to enact change for citizens who shouldn’t have to jump through legal hoops and financial struggles to just live. By sharing the knowledge of these communities, we can bring light to something as complicated as healthcare and make it accessible to those who wish to enact change</p>

Try to have these six containers provide a mix of calls to action and literature to support your cause. For instance, if you can find a local organization to call/volunteer/donate/etc., you may want to put their information in one of these containers. Likewise, your image may be a phone. The title of this image may be their organization. In the space where this is all typed, you will talk about them. If they are an organization, you may include their mission statement or their spokesperson or representative image. If it is literature, be sure to include significant evidence here.

                                    <p class="mb-4">    Racial Minorities have health disparities which in definition “is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women and other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups”(). This is a way to say that there are certain groups that get discriminated against in the healthcare system, this makes it difficult for people to get healthcare benefits. Not only does their race take into consideration getting healthcare also their ethnicity, education, income and geography. In a study shown in 2011 it states that the Healthcare department would do significantly better for the system to be taken down but since the companies are greedy about the healthcare system, the system would still be in place. Even if the system was taken down, there would still be the case of the quality of the healthcare, for instance they could receive poor quality of health care because of the place they are at or their poor education that they receive during school. Not only do Adults suffer from this but also children, the children are the last thing that needs to be discriminated against by the healthcare system. Children are the future of the planet if they live on a world where they are being discriminated against due to them being judged by their skin, then the world is just corrupted by greed.<br> In conclusion, we need to rewrite the healthcare system not only to people who are in the health disparities, but also to children who are in this system as well. The quicker the system gets taken down the quicker everyone can get healthcare and less fear of paying a huge amount for something small.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">By:Siersha Miller<br>        Gender inequality in the United States healthcare system greatly affects the care of  women and transgender individuals. This problem is well known to the world and often is recognized by the discrepancy between pain management and healthcare professionals not taking certain individuals as seriously when it comes to their treatment plans. Healthcare is a very vital part of every person's lives and is a part of their rights as a US citizen under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This declaration states that everyone is to be granted the right to universal health no matter the person's race, ethnicity, sex, gender, economic class, caste, disability, age, or location (Ostlin and Sen, 2008). However, because of the social norms in our society and implicit biases placed on people, multiple people of subgroups of the categories listed under the declaration are heavily discriminated against in the healthcare setting. Women and transgender individuals specifically being one of them.<br>      Women in society are often seen as less capable and more as objects rather than subjects of their own wills and desires.The same holds true for transgender individuals, as they are often discriminated against in almost every social setting, but especially healthcare (Ostlin and Sen, 2008). These things create a perception that they do not deserve or aren’t as important as men when it comes to their treatment and pain management. Because women suffer from menstrual pains and childbirth, there is a societal idea that women can handle more pain than men because they are made to, but in reality there is no difference in pain threshold or tolerance when all biases are removed (Samulowitz et al., 2018).Transgender individuals are often not given the same access to medications such as testosterone and estrogen because they are not deemed “necessary” by society. These are important things to understand because when other disadvantaged subgroups intersect with gender, the consequences of the biases in healthcare are exacerbated to a detrimental effect (Ostlin and Sen, 2008). For example, a lower middle class, black, transgender woman would be seriously disadvantaged when accessing american healthcare because she would be part of 4 marginalized groups, making her much more likely to not be taken as seriously or have adequate access to what she needs.<br>      Creating a gender equitable environment in healthcare is important because it is the basis of everyone’s quality of life and access to a good and healthy lifestyle. The elimination of gender biases will propel our society into an overall more gender equitable future in other aspects of life in addition to healthcare.</p>

These days sexual orientation/gender is all people talk about, some are confused but others are talking to tear others down. Why do people discriminate when they don’t know the person or situation?<br>          Healthcare works with sexual minorities on a daily basis. Lesbians have a higher prevalence of obesity and gay men are more likely to have hypertension.(Chandra L. Jackson, 17 august 2016). Others need to think to themselves, what if people were causing me that much stress that led to a medical crisis? It wouldn’t be very fair but that is what LGBTQ people have to deal with. When it comes to health insurance, sexual minority women are more likely to experience lack of insurance. The healthcare environment 	isn’t positive already so they have double the disadvantage in health care. (Kesha Baptiste-roberts, 2018 Mar 1). Several studies also show that they are more likely to delay care because of those factors.<br>           Our system is so broken that we can’t even provide medical necessities to other men and women. These statistics need to change or it will keep happening and end up even worse than it is right now. Sexual minorities will have different health needs like AIDS but we should respect their life and not judge or deny needed medical attention because people are different.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">In today's United States of America there is a lot of inequality in health care, medicare and insurance towards immigrants. In 2021 there were about 21 million non-citizens in the United States which is about 6% of the total population of the country, that includes lawful immigrants and undocumented immigrants as well. With that being said 25% of lawful immigrants are uninsured and uncovered and 46% of undocumented immigrants are as well. (Health Coverage and Care of Immigrants, Published: Dec 20, 2022).<br> Health care inequalities towards immigrants have various factors, including legal status, language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination.Immigrants' legal status is one of the biggest obstacles for them. This is because already being an undocumented immigrant you are scared of deportation and legal troubles if you get caught with anything, hence asking or trying to get medical insurance or cover with the government is a huge risk because it could cause several problems.<br> Language barriers also present a significant obstacle for immigrants seeking health care. Many healthcare providers in the United States only speak English, which can make it difficult for non-English speakers to communicate effectively with their doctors or understand important health information. This can lead to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment, which can end up harming the patient's health.Much like the language barriers cultural differences can also play a role in healthcare disparities for immigrant populations. Some immigrants may come from countries where healthcare practices and beliefs differ significantly from those in the United States. This can lead to misunderstandings between patients and healthcare providers, which can impact the quality of the care that they get.<br> The last but not least of the obstacles is the bias and the discrimination towards immigrant populations by others.Some healthcare providers may hold negative attitudes towards immigrants, which can lead to poorer quality care or even outright denial of care.Overall, addressing health care and Medicare inequalities towards immigrant populations in the United States will require a very in depth and multi faceted approach that includes legal reforms, language and cultural understanding training for healthcare providers, and efforts to combat discrimination and bias.</p>
